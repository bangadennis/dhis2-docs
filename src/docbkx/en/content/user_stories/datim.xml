    <section><title>DATIM: the background details</title><para>
            <para dir="ltr">In 2009 a DHIS2 pilot project was being tested in Rwanda. This project,
                which was being run by PEPFAR’s Mike Gehron and HISP Oslo’s Lars Helge Overland, was
                an extension of a Tanzanian health program called Promise. After five years of
                thoroughly shaping and structuring this pilot project, DHIS2 was deployed
                successfully and became Rwanda’s first national HMIS. The expertise and experience
                of this project was then scaled up to an even bigger project; in 2014 DHIS2 became
                the underlying technology of the largest software system ever dedicated to ending
                the AIDS epidemic: PEPFAR’s DATIM project.</para>

    <section><title>A data revolution</title><para><emphasis>“Things happened very fast at the time,”</emphasis> recalls Mike Gehron, founder of
            the project. <emphasis>“Upon the completion of the Rwanda pilot project in November
                2014, a new Global AIDS coordinator took up office. Deborah L. Birx had a data
                revolution mandate that she declared; to roll out a highly granular health system
                monitored from Washington D.C., to reach 700,000 health facilities across the world
                - in just four months. As this project was aligned with everything we were hoping to
                do and already had in place, it was conceivable for us to go ahead with it.”
            </emphasis></para>
        <para>DATIM’s deployment manager, Mark DeZalia, came onboard and was assigned the role of
            involving all fifty countries in getting DATIM implementations up and running. HISP Oslo
            hosted intensive training academies. As the project picked up momentum, teams were
            formed, the system was set up and in late 2014, DATIM went live across the world.</para></section>
